#+title: Fix Sandy Bridge power regression issue in 3.6-3.7 kernel

Proud owners of Intel Sandy Bridge-powered laptops have been
experiencing power regression problems for three months now. Starting
somewhere at 3.6.x kernel the power consumption suddenly seared high
as well as the overall CPU temperature. My typical laptop temperature
being around 45Â°C with introduction of 3.6 it rose to 80. Average
battery life jumped from 3-4 hours to pathetic hour and a half.
Briefly speaking the changes were too much to bear so I rolled back to
3.5.6 and stayed there for these three months.

Eventually the commit that introduced the regression was identified
but neither 3.6 branch nor 3.7 hadn't got it reverted in them. Only
3.8 branch finally fixed the problem but it is still in its release
candidate status, so it's a question when will it reach the general
audience.

I've been for some time following [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=150743&p=1][this thread]] where Arch users shared
their experiences with different kernel versions. William Giokas is a
regular poster there, and he is the person who kindly builds the
newest versions of the kernel for Arch Linux. Here's a [[http://sakuscans.com/pacmanpkg/x86_64/00README][README]] on how
to install his kernels instead of building them on your own.

After I had upgraded to 3.8-rc5 from 3.5.6 I didn't notice any visible
regression in power consumption and temperature. The temperature
floats around 47-48 degrees and the consumption averages on 15W mark.

The process of upgrading to kernel built by William is pretty
straightforward. Here it is step by step:

- add William's repo to your pacman.conf as described in README;
- install *linux-mainline* package;
- update grub to include the new kernel in the list;

#+begin_src sh
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
#+end_src

- rebuild *tlp* and *tp\_smapi-mainline* packages from AUR.

Now you can safely update all other packages that you otherwise
postponed because of the kernel rollback.
