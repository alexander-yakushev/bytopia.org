#+title: Raidcall on Wine: problem with dnsapi.dll

Recently I stuck with a problem that had no solution around the
Internet. Raidcall, a voice chat program exclusively for Windows,
refused to start under Wine referring to the absent (or wrong) library
dnsapi.dll. I found out that there is such library in
./wine/drive_c/windows/system32/ folder. Replacing this file with
original dnsapi.dll taken from Windows distribution didnâ€™t help. So
after that I opened *winecfg*, switched to *Libraries*, found
*dnsapi.dll (native)* in the list and just removed it (Remove button
is on the right). Then, after applying the changes, Raidcall finally
started.

Hope this would help somebody.
