#+title: Beautiful cheatsheet template in LaTeX
#+tags: latex emacs
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil author:nil

Yesterday I needed to make a cheatsheet for my coworkers, but I didn't want to
use online services or other proprietary tools. I turned to LaTeX, but there
weren't any enticing eye-candy templates that I would be proud to give out. [[http://wch.github.io/latexsheet/][This
template]] was the closest I could get, it looks neat by doesn't have a cherry on
the top.

So I spent an evening to pimp that template and turn it into something that you
can see below. Just edit the =cheatsheet.tex= file and compile it with
=xelatex=.
