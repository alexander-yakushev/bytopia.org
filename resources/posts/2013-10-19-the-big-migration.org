Although [[https://www.openshift.com/][OpenShift]] is a great service and fit all my needs completely,
I decided to move on. There were several reasons for that. First of
all, I wanted to have a more independent setup, bringing closer the
day when I can run my own server reliably. OS being an IAAS applies
certain restrictions on what you can and cannot do. Secondly, I hit
the limit of three cartridges provided by free, and while it was just
the amount I required, it prohibited me from doing any casual testing
and web-doodling from that account. And when the money becomes
involved, you apply a more careful judgment to where you wanna be.

So farewell Openshift, greetings [[https://www.digitalocean.com/][DigitalOcean]]. I picked DO mostly for,
I won't conceal it, the price tag. $5 is the exact amount I'm willing
to spend on a VPS so far, when there is also an option of not paying
at all. And for these $5 DigitalOcean provides a decent single-core
VPS with 20GB SSD storage space. This is more than enough for me right
now, and DO offers more advanced plans for roughly the same amount of
money as other VPS providers do. I opted for an instance in
San-Francisco (Amsterdam was unavailable when I was creating an
instance), and that gives me around 150 ms latency - which is
sufficient for my use-cases.

* Initial configuration

  As soon as DO gets your payment, you are eligible for creating a
  node (nodes are called droplets here). You pick a physical location,
  and the operating system to install on the droplet (I went for LTS
  Ubuntu) and in half a minute your droplet is ready. Boom.

  I used [[http://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers][this article]] to perform basic configuration and ensure some
  first-minute security. DigitalOcean also offers a fair bunch of
  [[https://www.digitalocean.com/community][tutorials]] on how to install common software on different
  distributions, how to configure SSL in Apache and so on.

  Following one of the above-mentioned tutorials, I installed
  and configured the LAMP stack. Never dealing with Apache in my
  life, I found it relatively easy to get it running, HTTPS
  included. There were a few not so smooth moments because Apache
  config layout is apparently distro-dependent, so you should search
  for documentation for your particular distribution.

  MySQL was fairly easy to get up since I already did that a couple
  of times. I also installed Phusion Passenger (from what I've
  understood, it's an application container for Ruby) directed by
  another guide on the web. And that was all for the software part.

  Finally, I obtained a valid and widely accepted SSL certificate from
  [[https://www.startssl.com/][StartSSL]]. [[https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free?hn][This tutorial]] explains the process step-by-step. StartSSL
  offers free certificates for your main domain and one subdomain. It
  seems like they also require you to verify your identity every
  month, but I'm yet to find out.

* Migrating sites and applications

  Of course, the blog (which is just a statically generated website)
  was the easiest to migrate. On the other hand, [[https://github.com/phusion/juvia][the commenting system]]
  gave me a lot of trouble. I couldn't get the damn thing to work
  because of the build errors, and I had to contact on of the
  maintainers on Github to help me with that. Turned out that Ruby 1.9
  and 2.0 compatibility has its quirks the same as Pythons do (it was
  news for me). After I fixed versions in a few dependency lines, it
  all went good.

  Finally, I transitioned my [[http://owncloud.org/][ownCloud]] server. That perhaps was the
  main reason to move to a VPS - I wanted to keep my data a little
  closer, and all in one place. Now I use the 20GB I was provided with
  to store my photos, books and random files I move across devices. I
  also tried to store music (ownCloud has a web audio player and even
  a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampache][Ampache]] server to stream music), but at that point ownCloud upload
  speed was just terrible (and I wasn't able to make ownCloud
  recognize the files I manually copied via _scp_), so I gave up on
  that idea. I hope it is fixed by now, though I haven't tried since.

  Besides data, ownCloud also keeps my contacts and calendars. I had
  to spend a couple of bucks on [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.caldav.lib][CalDAV]] and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.carddav.sync][CardDAV]] clients for Android
  (which is such a shame, even iPhones have native Cal/CardDAV
  support), but it pretty much worth it. Now I don't rely on Google
  for managing that information, but it is still nicely synchronized
  between all my devices (and the Web interface for them is also
  rather good).

  By the way, ownCloud is modular, so all kinds of plugins for it are
  written and being written to meet the needs of every user. Its
  community also greatly benefited from the recent PRISM scandal. Thus
  If you write in PHP and are worried about your data safety, you can
  join the cause.

* Blog updates

  It is apparent that I spend more time tweaking the blog than
  actually writing, but I really can't help it. This time I worked on
  the sidebar and added a pair of widgets there (Web 1.0 galore). You
  can see them on the index page. The first one is a Goodreads widgets
  that shows the latest books I've finished reading. The second is a
  Jamendo widget which allows you to listen to the music I discovered
  recently. Give it a try, it is free as in freedom.

  Currently I'm also trying to replace the Google Analytics suite
  with a personally hosted software called [[http://piwik.org/][Piwik]]. That will be
  another step in stripping the vendor-locked parts in my setup.

  To summarize it all, join us now and share the software! You'll be
  free, hackers, if you decide to.
