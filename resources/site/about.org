OK, since you are here, my name's Alex. If I were to describe myself
in three statements they would be: student, bald, loves tinkering with
things. Some of those things I've tinkered with will appear in this
blog, and whether you like them or not I would be delighted to hear
your thoughts and comments.

The name "Bytopia" comes from Dungeons and Dragons lore where it is a
plane of existence also known as "Twin Paradises of Bytopia". I kind
of like the name and how it sounds like /byte-op-ia/ so I've picked it as
the domain (couldn't get .com though :-/). I hope Wizards of the Coast
don't get mad at me for that.

This site would never happen if not for these marvelous gems of
software: [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]], [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], [[https://github.com/nakkaya/static][static]]. I am much obliged to their
authors for creating such a great projects and sharing them with
everyone.

Feel free to contact me at any time for any possible reason (except
for selling pills and reclaiming Nigerian princes' heritage,
preferably) at [[mailto:alex@bytopia.org][alex@bytopia.org]]. Sometimes I hang around on #clojure
channel at [[http://freenode.net/][freenode]] as /alexyakushev/.
