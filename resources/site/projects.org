Throughout my conscious life in IT I accumulated a couple of projects
that might be worth sharing. Here's the list of them structured by
categories.

** Clojure

   - [[https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid][lein-droid]] --- a Leiningen plugin for building Clojure/Android applications.
   - [[https://github.com/clojure-android/neko][Neko]] --- a toolkit library for developing Android applications in idiomatic
     Clojure.
   - [[http://clojure-android.info/][clojure-android.info]] --- central site of Clojure-Android initiative
   - [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dorg.bytopia.foreclojure][4Clojure for Android]] --- Android client for 4clojure.com website ([[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/foreclojure-android][source]]).
   - [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment][Compliment]] --- Clojure auto-completion library you deserve.
   - [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-cider][ac-cider]] --- Emacs Auto-Complete plugin for interaction with CIDER.
   - [[github.com/grammarly/omniconf][Omniconf]] - fancy configuration library for Clojure applications.

** Awesome WM

   I've been an avid Awesome user for about six years now. I love this window
   manager as well as the ability to modify and extend it in every possible way.

   - [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/awesomerc][devotion]] - an advanced Awesome theme/environment I currently use.
   - [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/menubar][menubar]] - a dmenu-style application launcher.
   - [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/awesompd][awesompd]] - highly functional MPD widget/client with [[http://www.jamendo.com/][Jamendo]] support.
